# Hagen Cumulative Science Project I 
### Estimating the Reproducibility of JDM Research


#### Research objective

- It has been [proposed recently](https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2015/09/13/replicability-report-for-the-journal-judgment-and-decision-making/) on theoretical grounds that results published in *"Judgment and Decision Making"* are better replicable than results published in other psychology journals.



- To test this hypothesis empirically, master and bachelor students writing their final thesis in the division of cognitive psychology (head Dr. Susann Fiedler and Dr. Andreas Glöckner) at the FernUniversität in Hagen will systematically replicate studies published in *"Judgment and Decision Making"*. 


- The "Hagen Cumulative Science Project I" thereby supports the current debate on the replicability of research in psychology and introduces future generations of researchers to the method of replication.

#### Results

- The following ShinyApp (based on R) illustrates the results of the following research on a test dataset. 


- Namely, in the DataTable the gathered replication dataset is presented with the links to the original papers along with the other information about the replicated study. 


- The latter 3 plots at *tabPanels* are illustrating the confidence intervals of the original studies, replication studies and simultaneous representation of both values respectively. 


- The researchers are encouraged to use following template as for their result presentation. To use it, please fork the repository and use your *google docs link* in **url <- "google docs link"**.
