# Hagen Cumulative Science Project I (Estimating the Reproducibility of JDM Research)

It has been proposed recently on theoretical grounds that results published in “Judgment and Decision Making” are better replicable than results published in other psychology journals (https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2015/09/13/replicability-report-for-the-journal-judgment-and-decision-making/). 

To test this hypothesis empirically, master and bachelor students writing their final thesis in the division of cognitive psychology (head Dr. Susann Fiedler and Dr. Andreas Glöckner) at the FernUniversität in Hagen will systematically replicate studies published in “Judgment and Decision Making”. The „Hagen Cumulative Science Project I” thereby supports the current debate on the replicability of research in psychology and introduces future generations of researchers to the method of replication.

The following ShinyApp in R illustrates the results of the following research on a #test dataset. Namely, in the DataTable the gathered replication dataset is presented with the links to the original papers along with the other information about the replicated study. The latter 3 plots are illustrating the confidence intervals of the original, replication, and both values respectively.
